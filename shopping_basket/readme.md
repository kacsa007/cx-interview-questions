## Documentation


This code was developed in pycharm university license

I left all debug messages there, that's kind of reflecting the logic i was using when developing this small app. 
I left notes on how i would structure the code if that would be in production. I didn't spend much time on putting everything is sepparte modules 
as I was more focusing on the logic of creating the methods.

The test is written only for the cases from the assigmend.md
The code is also designed to follow PEP8 standards, verified and developed on personal environment using Pycharm Professional Version

You cun run the tests using this command: 

* python -m unittest shopping_basket_tests.shop_test
